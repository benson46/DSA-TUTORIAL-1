ðŸ“Œ What is a Stack?
A stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO (Last In, First Out). The last element inserted is the first to be removed.


ðŸ“Œ Key Operations:
stack.push(element);  // Insert at top
stack.pop();          // Remove from top
stack.peek();         // View top element
stack.isEmpty();      // Check if empty
stack.size();         // Number of elements

ðŸ“˜ Binary Search
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm used to search for an element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

    How it works:
          Start with the middle element of the sorted list.
          If the middle element is the target, return its index.
          If the target is less than the middle element, narrow the search to the left half.
          If the target is greater than the middle element, narrow the search to the right half.
          Repeat the process on the new sublist until the target is found or the list is exhausted.

    Time Complexity:
        Best case: O(1) (element found at the middle)
        Worst case: O(log n) (repeatedly halving the list)

Comparison between Linear and Binary Search:

        Feature                 	Linear Search	                            Binary Search
        Data Requirement	        Can be used on unsorted lists	            Requires sorted lists
        Time Complexity	            O(n)	                                    O(log n)
        Space Complexity	        O(1)	                                    O(1)
        Efficiency	                Less efficient for large lists	            More efficient for large sorted lists

        


When to Use:
Linear Search: Use when the list is unsorted or small.
Binary Search: Use for large sorted lists, as itâ€™s much faster.

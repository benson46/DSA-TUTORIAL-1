ðŸ“˜ 9. Recursion
A function calls itself to break down problems into sub-problems.

    ðŸ”¹ Types:
            Head Recursion: Recursive call happens before processing the function.
            Tail Recursion: Recursive call happens last (can be optimized)

            Direct Recursion: A function calling itself is called direction
            Indirect Recursion: A calls B â†’ B calls A

    ðŸ”¹ Applications:
            Backtracking (e.g., Sudoku, N-Queens)
            Mathematical (Factorial, GCD, Fibonacci)
            Divide & Conquer (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
            Graphs (DFS)
            Trees (Traversal)

ðŸ“˜ Linear Search
Linear Search is a simple algorithm that checks each element of a list (array) sequentially until it finds the target element or reaches the end of the list.

        How it works:
                Start from the first element.
                Compare the target element with the current element.
                If they match, return the index of the element.
                If they donâ€™t match, move to the next element and repeat until the target is found or the end of the list is reached.

        Time Complexity:
                Best case: O(1) (element found at the first position)

                Worst case: O(n) (element is not in the list or at the end)

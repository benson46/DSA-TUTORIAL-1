/*


A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes

each node consist of a data value and a pointer that points to the next node

the list elements can be easily inserted  or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure

random access of element is not feasible and accessing an  element has linear time complexity

The linked list data structure supports three main operations

  1, insertion - to add an element at the beginning , end or at a given index in list
  2, deletion - to remove an item given its index or value
  3, search - to find an element  given its value

// Linked list usage

/* 

all applications of both stack and queues are applications of linked list

image viewer is an example in real world (you can continuously watch a slideshow)
